🐝 The Hive

The Hive is a Solana-based autonomous agent designed to scan trending memecoins, deploy experimental betas on Pump.fun, and route all creator fees directly back into HIVE through structured buybacks.

The core idea is simple:

More deploys → more creator fees → more buybacks → a stronger ecosystem.

The Hive operates as a self-reinforcing system. It identifies momentum in the memecoin market, deploys strategically, collects creator fees, and uses those fees to accumulate HIVE — continuously strengthening the primary token.

Everything is transparent and tracked live on the dashboard:

Deployments

Creator fee claims

Buybacks

Ecosystem growth metrics

No hidden mechanics. No manual intervention. Just an agent executing its strategy on-chain.

Philosophy:

The Hive is built around long-term ecosystem compounding. Instead of extracting value, it cycles value back into the main token. The goal isn’t short-term hype — it’s building an autonomous system that continuously feeds the core.

Built by bees.
